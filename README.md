## üß† Research Background

This project is based on academic research on nutritional problems among university students (18-25 years). Key findings include:
- Students prioritize cost over nutrition, leading to poor dietary choices
- There's a lack of centralized information about affordable, healthy food options
- Time constraints further complicate healthy eating habits

Our solution directly addresses these issues by providing an easy-to-use platform that centralizes information about affordable and nutritious food options.
